# S_Classify-ML-RandomSubwET-Pred-BI
A Cytomine software for classifying crops with Random subwindows and ExtraTrees: a previously built model (using Train algorithm) is applied on a list of annotations, using algorithm (Marée et al., Pattern recognition letters 2017, http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/191267).

This software is a contribution from the [ULiège Cytomine research team](https://uliege.cytomine.org/)
